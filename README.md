# matchgates


## Introduction
This is a pure python implementation of matchgate simulation via mapping to free fermions. It includes functionality for simulation of pure matchgate circuits, and also noisy matchgate circuits, with matchgate noise (via monte-carlo method).


## Installation
    pip install -e .

## Tests
    pytest

## Examples
Examples of running simulations both for pure and noisy matchgate circuits can be found in the examples folder.
